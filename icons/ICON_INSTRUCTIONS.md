## 📌 Required Icons

The extension requires three icon sizes:
- **16x16** pixels - Toolbar icon
- **48x48** pixels - Extension management page
- **128x128** pixels - Chrome Web Store

## 🎨 Creating Icons

### Option 1: Use Online Icon Generator

1. Visit [IconGenerator](https://icon-generator.net/) or [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)
2. Create an icon with these design elements:
   - Email envelope symbol (📧)
   - Graph/network nodes (representing knowledge graph)
   - Purple/blue gradient theme (#667eea to #764ba2)
3. Download icons in 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 sizes
4. Rename them to:
   - `icon16.png`
   - `icon48.png`
   - `icon128.png`
5. Place them in the `icons/` folder

### Option 2: Use Emoji-based Icons (Quick & Simple)

For development/testing purposes, you can use emoji-based icons:

1. Visit [Emoji to Image](https://emoji.aranja.com/) or similar service
2. Use the 📧 emoji with a purple background
3. Download in required sizes
4. Save as `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`
5. Place in `icons/` folder

### Option 3: Create with Image Editor

If you have design software (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma):

**Design Specifications:**
- **Background:** Gradient from #667eea (top) to #764ba2 (bottom)
- **Symbol:** White email envelope with small graph nodes/connections
- **Style:** Modern, flat design with slight shadow
- **Format:** PNG with transparency support

**Canvas Sizes:**
- 16x16 px
- 48x48 px  
- 128x128 px

## 🚀 Quick Placeholder Icons

Until you create custom icons, you can use placeholder text-based icons:

The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default puzzle piece. To test functionality immediately, you can:

1. Create solid color PNG files in the required sizes with any online tool
2. Use a simple colored square (purple #667eea)
3. Add text "EA" (Email Analyzer) in white
